## JSON format

The app expects a JSON array of series objects. Each series contains issues, and each issue can contain variants.

Example structure:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Magik",
    "publisher": "Marvel",
    "dates": "1983–1984 · Vol. 1",
    "key_issues": 2,
    "total_issues": 4,
    "issues": [
      {
        "title": "Magik #1",
        "publisher": "Marvel",
        "year": "1983",
        "is_key": true,
        "key_badge": "1st Appearance",
        "cover_image": "https://...",
